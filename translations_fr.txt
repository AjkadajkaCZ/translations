 aiBow: "The bow does a little bit of instant torpor damage and the rest of the torpor is added over the next 4 seconds.

This is especially useful for creatures with high torpor regeneration or high health.",
aiBow: "",   
 aiCrossbow: "The crossbow does a little bit of instant torpor damage and the rest of the torpor is added over the next 4 seconds. This means that for the best torpor-to-damage ratio, you need to wait 5 seconds between shots. However, since torpor stacks, you can also fire arrows as quickly as you can. This is especially useful for creatures with high torpor regeneration or high health.",
aiCrossbow: "",   
 aiCompound_Bow: "The compound bow is slightly better than the bow, but doesn't exceed the crossbow in dealing torpor. Therefore it is not the most efficient bow for taming.",
aiCompound_Bow: "",   
 aiLongneck_and_Dart: "The longneck rifle can make use of the new tranquilizer darts to knock out enemies. Currently, these are one of the best weapons to apply torpor to a creature.",
aiLongneck_and_Dart: "",   
 aiSlingshot: "Throwing rocks at your opponent is better than using your fists, however your melee damage does not apply here since it is about projectiles. Make sure you input the damage percentage of your slingshot in the field.",
aiSlingshot: "",   
 aiElectric_Prod: "The electric prod is the latest addition to the ARK. It does a massive amount of torpor damage and no damage to health. This makes it a perfect device for knocking out creatures for taming. Note that the weapon is single-use, so you might need multiple prods to knock out larger creatures.",
aiElectric_Prod: "",   
 aiWooden_Club: "The club can be used to knock out your opponent and is based on both your melee damage and the damage percentage of the club itself. You can input your character's melee damage on the settings page of the app.",
aiWooden_Club: "",   
 aiFists: "Your fists (and the wooden club) are the only 'weapons' that will be influenced by your own melee damage, since it is not a projectile. Make sure you set your melee damage on the settings page.",
aiFists: "",   
 aiScorpion: "The scorpion applies torpor to its target in a timespan of 10 seconds. In between these 10 seconds, you are not able to apply torpor to the target again. If you decide to attack a target while these 10 seconds are not over yet, you will only inflict normal damage and no torpor damage.",
aiScorpion: "",   
 aiArthropluera: "The Arthropluera's main attack deals torpor damage and can therefore be used for taming. However, the torpor is applied to the target in a timespan of 10 seconds and the torpor attacks do not stack in this case. The Arthropluera is slightly better than the scorpion for knocking creatures out.",
aiArthropluera: "",   
 aiBeelzebufo: "Much like the scorpion, the Beelzebufo applies torpor to its target in a timespan of 10 seconds. In between these 10 seconds, you are not able to apply torpor to the target again. If you decide to attack a target while these 10 seconds are not over yet, you will only inflict normal damage and no torpor damage. Furthermore, the Beelzebufo has two types of attacks which do different amounts of torpor damage. The left mousebutton attack (shoot out tonque) will result in less torpor damage, and is denoted by the maximum amount of licks you will need. Alternatively, the right mousebutton attack (tonque swing) is denoted by the minimum amount of licks.",
aiBeelzebufo: "",   
 aiPachy: "The pachy has two kinds of attacks, charged and non-charged, that both do instant torpor damage to the target. The charged attack, indicated by the minimum amount of blows, does much more torpor damage than the non-charged attack, however the attack is hard to steer in the right direction.",

For killing, it is necessary to kill the creatures yourself and not with your mount to get the dossier. Currently you also need to kill the 3 bosses to fully unlock your survivor profile. For more information on which creatures to tame and kill, check out the survivor profile in the app.",
