en:  "The bow does a little bit of instant torpor damage and the rest of the torpor is added over the next 4 seconds.

en:  "The crossbow does a little bit of instant torpor damage and the rest of the torpor is added over the next 4 seconds.

af:  "",
en:  "The compound bow is slightly better than the bow, but doesn't exceed the crossbow in dealing torpor. Therefore it is not the most efficient bow for taming.",
af:  "",
en:  "The boomerang can be used to knockout creatures from a distance, without using ammo. If the Boomerang hits a target, it will fly straight back to you. If you miss, it will return by flying back to your counter-clockwise.",
af:  "",
en:  "The longneck rifle can make use of the new tranquilizer darts to knock out enemies. Currently, these are one of the best weapons to apply torpor to a creature.",
af:  "",
en:  "The longneck rifle can make use of the new shocking tranquilizer darts to knock out enemies. These do twice as much torpor damage as the regular darts, but will spoil after 4 hours.",
af:  "", 
en:  "Throwing rocks at your opponent is better than using your fists, however your melee damage does not apply here since it is about projectiles. Make sure you input the damage percentage of your slingshot in the field.",
af:  "",
en:  "The electric prod is the latest addition to the ARK. It does a massive amount of torpor damage and no damage to health. This makes it a perfect device for knocking out creatures for taming. Note that the weapon is single-use, so you might need multiple prods to knock out larger creatures.",
af:  "",
en:  "The club can be used to knock out your opponent and is based on both your melee damage and the damage percentage of the club itself. You can input your character's melee damage on the settings page of the app.",
af:  "",
en:  "Your fists (and the wooden club) are the only 'weapons' that will be influenced by your own melee damage, since it is not a projectile. Make sure you set your melee damage on the settings page.",

en:  "The scorpion applies torpor to its target in a timespan of 10 seconds. In between these 10 seconds, you are not able to apply torpor to the target again. If you decide to attack a target while these 10 seconds are not over yet, you will only inflict normal damage and no torpor damage.",
af:  "",
en:  "The Arthropluera's main attack deals torpor damage and can therefore be used for taming. However, the torpor is applied to the target in a timespan of 10 seconds and the torpor attacks do not stack in this case. The Arthropluera is slightly better than the scorpion for knocking creatures out.",
af:  "",
en:  "Much like the scorpion, the Beelzebufo applies torpor to its target in a timespan of 10 seconds. In between these 10 seconds, you are not able to apply torpor to the target again. If you decide to attack a target while these 10 seconds are not over yet, you will only inflict normal damage and no torpor damage. Furthermore, the Beelzebufo has two types of attacks which do different amounts of torpor damage. The left mousebutton attack (shoot out tonque) will result in less torpor damage, and is denoted by the maximum amount of licks you will need. Alternatively, the right mousebutton attack (tonque swing) is denoted by the minimum amount of licks.",
af:  "",
en:  "The pachy has two kinds of attacks, charged and non-charged, that both do instant torpor damage to the target. The charged attack, indicated by the minimum amount of blows, does much more torpor damage than the non-charged attack, however the attack is hard to steer in the right direction.",

//Timer explanation
en:  "Why starve taming?",
af:  "",
en:  "To get things straight: starve taming does not have any influence on the total time your tame will take. Instead, it is mostly used to minimize risk on important tames. The advantage of starve taming is that you don't use food yet, meaning that you can leave a tame if it for instance gets hit (and the effectiveness gets lowered), without losing your precious kibble.",
af:  "",
en:  "How does the starve timer work?",
af:  "",
en:  "First, make sure you have selected the right creature, level and food you are using for the tame.",
af:  "",
en:  "Fill in the max food stat of the creature you have knocked unconscious in the 'Max food' field",
af:  "",
en:  "Fill in the current food value of the creature, keep in mind that this can go down pretty quickly.",
af:  "",
en:  "Optionally; set an alarm by checking the box and setting a value when you want to be noticed. Tip: make sure you will have enough time to get back to your game when you hear the alarm.",
af:  "",
en:  "Press start to start the timer. You can also leave the app (and even kill it), as the timer will work in the background in those cases.",
af:  "",
en:  "What does the target food indicate?",
af:  "",
en:  "Some creatures will not have a high enough food stat to be fully starved. If that is the case, the target food will be negative and indicate that, when its food has reached 0, can not be tamed in one go. If this is the case, the starve timer will count down until the food has reached 0. If the creature has a high enough food stat, the target food value will indicate when the creature has lost enough food to eat everything in one go. If you've then reached this target value, fill the creature up and watch it eat everything until tamed!",
af:  "",
en:  "How does the narcotic timer work?",
af:  "",
en:  "Simply put, the narcotic timer counts down from the given torpor amount until 0. You only have to fill in the creature's current torpor and press start for it to work.",
af:  "",
en:  "Tip: Make sure to set the alarm in a way that you will be able to reach the creature in time; it WILL wake up if it reaches 0.",
af:  "",
en:  "What do the icons above the timer mean?",
af:  "",
en:  "You can toggle between the use of narcotics and narcoberries by using the icons above the timer. This will change the indications of the amount and time needed to fully refill the creature's torpor.",

For killing, it is necessary to kill the creatures yourself and not with your mount to get the dossier. Currently you also need to kill the 3 bosses to fully unlock your survivor profile.
